// The HUD's palette degrades the same way every time: somebody needs a colour
// mid-edit, types the hex inline, and the token quietly stops being the single
// source of that value. Four had already drifted that far — a white hero ink,
// the module registry's slate, the ground under every meter track, and a gold
// that was neither `lockedGold` nor `goldInk` but sat between them.
//
// So this file is a source oracle rather than a render test: it reads the HUD
// directory off disk and fails on the literal, naming the token that owns the
// value now. Nothing here renders, because the point is not what one component
// paints — it is that no component anywhere writes the number down again.
//
// The list is meant to grow. Every time a value earns a name in `hudTheme.ts`,
// ban the hex it used to be spelled as.
//
// The palette degrades a second way too, and this file guards that as well: two
// tokens quietly holding the SAME value. `warning` was chrome orange to the
// digit, which meant the middle severity had a name, a doc comment, and no
// color — every warning the HUD ever raised looked like part of the frame.
